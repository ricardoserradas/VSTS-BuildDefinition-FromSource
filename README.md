# VSTS-BuildDefinition-FromSource
VSTS Extensions that allows you to create a build definition directly from a source control node.

This project is on **hold** until the VSTS API gives us the ability to create build definitions programatically.

Until now, we have **Read-Only** access to the Builds API.

## Observations

This feature won't be useful for Git based projects, since it does not allow you to download only part of your repo.
